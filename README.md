# Reinforcement Learning Project

This project focuses on implementing and experimenting with reinforcement learning algorithms. It includes Python scripts for defining and training reinforcement learning models, along with the required environment configurations.

## Project Overview

- **Reinforcement Learning Algorithms**: The project implements reinforcement learning methods in Python, aiming to solve specific problems or tasks.
- **Environment Setup**: A virtual environment is configured to manage dependencies, ensuring the project can be run in a clean and isolated Python environment.

## Project Structure

- **Reinforcment.py**: The main script containing the reinforcement learning algorithm implementation.
- **reinforcment_learning.py**: Additional utilities or supporting code for reinforcement learning experiments.
- **env/**: A Python virtual environment that contains the required dependencies for running the project.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x**: Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your machine.

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Reinforcment.git
    cd Reinforcment
    ```

2. **Set Up Virtual Environment**:
    Create and activate the Python virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
    Install any necessary dependencies

## Running the Project

To run the reinforcement learning model, execute the main script:
```bash
python Reinforcment.py

## Project Workflow

1. **Algorithm Definition**: Define the reinforcement learning algorithm in `Reinforcment.py`.

2. **Training**: Train the model using a predefined environment.

3. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance on specific tasks or problems.
